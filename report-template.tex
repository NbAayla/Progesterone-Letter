\noindent [Doctor Name],\\\\
I am sending you this letter to ask for a prescription for bioidentical progesterone to aid my transition from male to female. Progesterone is a critical hormone for my affirmed sex. Without it, my ability to transition completely is compromised and I am at a heightened risk for severe health problems such as low bone mineral density, cardiovascular diseases, and breast cancer.

\paragraph{Too Long; Didn't Read} The Endocrine Society advises clinicians to target sex hormone levels within normal ranges for the affirmed sex of transgender patients. Progesterone (P\tsub{4}) is a critical female sex hormone with significant roles in important bodily functions and development. You should prescribe \textbf{bioidentical} oral micronized Progesterone with the goal of bringing my P\tsub{4} levels within the normal range for my affirmed sex (female). If you are satisfied with this justification, further reading is unnecessary.

\section{Why Prescribe Progesterone?}
In 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines for treatment of Gender-Dysphoric / Gender-Incongruent Persons, the Endocrine Society advises clinicians to ``maintain sex hormone levels within the normal range for the person's affirmed gender\sidecite{hembree_cohen_2017}.'' In fertile cisgender\sidenote{Meaning their gender identity as a woman aligns with their female sex assigned at birth} women, normal menstrual cycles produce Estradiol (E\tsub{2}), which I am already taking, but also progesterone (P\tsub{4}). P\tsub{4} has important effects not only in the pelvic and sex organs, but in the entire body. This means that, to be within the normal ranges for the sex hormones of my affirmed gender as Endocrine Society guidance calls for, I need P\tsub{4} as well as the E\tsub{2} I am already taking.\\

\noindent Progesterone has several effects for both cisgender and transgender women. As found by Dr. Jerilynn C Prior\sidenote{An American endocrinologist specializing in menstrual cycles, the effects of hormones on women's health, and a leader in understanding and treating menopause / perimenopause.}, ``rather than being treated with daily E2 and an antiandrogen, as is the current clinical practice, to follow guidelines, we need to prescribe oral micronized progesterone (referred to in this article as progesterone) as an at least cyclic component of treatment of all transgender women\sidecite{10.1210/jc.2018-01777}.'' She also noted the effects of P\tsub{4} when treating transgender women including more rapid feminization, suppression of gonadal androgen production, optimal breast maturation (of which P\tsub{4} is a prerequisite), increasing bone mineral density, and improved cardiovascular physiology.

\section{What Is Progesterone?}

In cisgendered women, P\tsub{4} is a sex hormone important for pregnancy, embryogenisis, and the regulation of ovulation and menstruation. However, P\tsub{4} also has important roles outside of the pelvic and sex organs.

\section{Effects of P\tsub{4}}
In both cisgender and transgender women, P\tsub{4} has several important effects on human development and health:
\subsection{Breasts}

\subsubsection{Lobuloalveolar Development}
When combined with the protein Prolactin, P\tsub{4} mediates lobuloalveolar maturation of the mammary glands, allowing for milk production, lactation, and breastfeeding\sidecite{macias_hinck_2012}.

\subsubsection{Ductal Development}
P\tsub{4} is necessary for the development of ductal branching within the breast and general maturation, including the enlargement of the areola\sidecite{robinson_2000}. Without it, as frequently seen in transgender women, breasts remain in Tanner stage 3 indefinitely\sidecite{fisher_castellini_2017}. This lack of breast maturation is why the majority of current transgender women seek breast augmentation surgery\sidecite{wierckx_mueller_weyers_caenegem_roef_heylens_tsjoen_2012}.

\subsubsection{Reduced Breast Cancer Risk}
Studies indicate that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone (what I am currently prescribed) results in a significant (1.29-fold) increase in the risk for invasive breast cancer. This risk elevation was eliminated with the inclusion of bioidentical progesterone.\\

\noindent While synthetic progestins\sidenote{Such as medroxyprogesterone acetate} have been found to increase the risk of breast cancer. In a study\sidecite{fournier_berrino_clavel-chapelon_2007} of postmenopausal women (n=80,377) from 1990 to 2002, compared to never using hormone replacement therapy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HRT with estrogen alone lead to a 1.29-fold increased risk of invasive breast cancer.
    \item HRT with estrogen combined with synthetic estrogens led to a 1.69-fold increased risk of invasive breast cancer.
    \item HRT with estrogen combined with bioidentical progesterone lead to a relative risk of 1.00, meaning no change in risk from the control group that didn't use HRT.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Skin Health}
Estrogen and P\tsub{4} receptors have been detected in the skin. During and after menopause, decreased levels of female sex hormones result in atrophy, thinning of the skin as well as a reduction is elasticity, firmness, and strength\sidecite{Holzer2005EffectsAS}. Hormone replacement therapy, consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal women, such as increased skin collagen content, improved thickness and elasticity, and better skin hydration\sidecite{Raine-Fenning2003}.

\subsection{Sexuality}
Progesterone, along with its active metabolite allopregnanolone, are important for libido\sidecite{king_2013}.

\subsection{Nervous System}
\subsubsection{Neurosteroidal Effects}
P\tsub{4} is a neurosteroid, meaning it can be metabolized within all parts of the central nervous system. Neurosteroids are used by neurons to regulate themselves, protect their structure and function, and regulate transmission between neurons. 

\subsubsection{Protection from Brain Damage}
Studies and animal models have shown that P\tsub{4} not only supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, but also has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue which decreases susceptibility to traumatic brain injuries\sidecite{roof_hall_2000}.
